# week-4-game

### Overview

Created a crystal collector game, each crystal image holds a certain value every round of the game. Using Javascript I made a loop that constantly compares the player's total score to the randomized value that they are aiming to match.'

### Languages/Technologies Used

HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Google Fonts

### Updates
Last update: Updated the styling for the page to appeal more to the player; corrected the calculating of crystal values so the player's score is updated correctly.
